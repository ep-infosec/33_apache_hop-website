The Apache Hop team just released version 2.1.0.  The immediate next goal for us is to release version 2.2.0 with over 100 fixes and improvements.

Here are a few directions that we want to explore for the future of our software:

* Authentication plugins for various security providers (3.x)
* Integration with authentication for the VFS plugins (3.x)
* S3 compatible object store support through updated AWS libs (3.x)
* Creation of a 'hop' command with sub-commands (3.x)
* Set up a software marketplace where 3rd party plugins can be found (3.x)
* Finish conversion of all plugins to generic XML serialization to allow for JSON/YAML/... metadata serialization of pipelines and workflows (3.0)
* Pluggable field expressions in transforms and actions (4.x)
* Integration with Apache Airflow both in Airflow and as a new Workflow engine plugin
* Environment level plugin support for hardware and software setup validation
* MongoDB: API update to support Atlas
* A new docker/k8s pipeline/workflow engine
* Render pipelines/workflows as SVG in Hop Web
* ...
