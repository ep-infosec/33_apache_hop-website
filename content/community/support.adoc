## Getting Help

If you are experiencing problems using Hop then please report your problem to our https://hop.apache.org/community/mailing-list/[mailing lists, window="blank"]. This allows the entire community to help with your problem.

If you found an issue or have a feature request, pleaae create a ticket in our https://github.com/apache/hop/issues[GitHub Issue Tracker, window="blank"]. Adding plenty of details (stack trace, logs, screenshots, ...) makes it easier for the Hop developers to know what you exactly mean, and will allow us to resolve your ticket faster.

## Alternative discussion forums and information

There are a number of sites outside Apache that offer discussion forums or information on Hop. You may find helpful discussions on technical blogs, e,g, (https://medium.com/codex/build-data-pipeline-with-apache-hop-62417ecee303[1, window="blank"]), (http://diethardsteiner.github.io/[2, window="blank"]), on https://www.google.com/search?q=apache+hop[Google, window="blank"], or even on https://twitter.com/search?q=%23apachehop&src=typed_query[Twitter, window="blank"].


## How to get help

When you report an issue, please be sure to include as much information as possible. The more we know, the easier it is to reach an effective solution quickly.

A couple of usefull things to check or to provide when you report an issue are:

* what are the version numbers of involved software components? (this is very important to detail)

* what platform and JDK?

* any particular container being used? and if so, what version?

* stack traces generally really help! (Remember to post which version of Hop you use, this is important to know when posting stacktraces) If in doubt, include the whole thing; often exceptions get wrapped in other exceptions and the exception right near the bottom explains the actual error, not the first few lines at the top. It’s very easy for us to skim-read past unnecessary parts of a stack trace.

* log output can be useful too; sometimes enabling DEBUG logging can help

* your code & configuration files are often useful

* did it work before? where there any configuration or other changes in your setup before it broke?

* try upgrading to the latest release or nighly build and see if it’s fixed there

* and check the issue tracker to see if the issue has already been reported

* please do not send private emails or chat pm messages to Hop Team members to ask them to help you faster. Help on Apache Hop is volunteer based and works best in the open (on the public Mailing Lists, chat etc), so others can learn and benefit from your problems and solutions. If you want to get help faster or in private, then see further below.

## How to get help faster

We can help you much quicker if you try the following:

* provide us with a pipeline, workflow or JUnit test case that demonstrates your issue. e.g. if you think you’ve found a bug, can you create a test case to demonstrate the bug?

* if you're a developer: create a pull request with a fix for your bug! (We also buy you beer when we meet you if you submit bug fixes ;-) )

## Commercial support

Apache Hop is an open source project, so the amount of time we have available to help resolve your issue is often limited as all help is provided on a volunteer basis. If you want to get priority help, need to get up to speed quickly, require some training or mentoring, or need full 24 x 7 production support you could contact one of the following companies with xref:/community/commercial/index.adoc[Commercial Hop Offerings, window="blank"].
