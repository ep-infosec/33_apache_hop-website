|ID|Description|Status
|CD10|The project produces Open Source software for distribution to the public, at no charge.|The project source code is licensed under the Apache License, version 2.0.
|CD20|Anyone can easily discover and access the project's code.|The Apache Hop (Incubating) source code is available on https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=hop.git[GitBot] and http://github.com/apache/hop[github]
|CD30|Anyone using standard, widely-available tools, can build the code in a reproducible way.|The Apache Hop (Incubating) is built after each commit and integration tests are run on a daily basis on the https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Hop/[ASF Jenkins server]. + Development environment setup and build instructions are http://hop.apache.org/dev-manual/latest/setup-dev-environment.html[documented] on the Hop website.
|CD40|The full history of the project's code is available via a source code control system, in a way that allows anyone to recreate any released version.| The entire commit history is available from the https://github.com/apache-hop/commit/e24b53ea7dfe6bcad9e03011d1ce88eeb1bb7edc[beginning].
|CD50|The source code control system establishes the provenance of each line of code in a reliable way, based on strong authentication of the committer. When third parties contribute code, commit messages provide reliable information about the code provenance.|The project uses the git repository, managed by Apache Infra, ensuring provenance of each line of code to a committer. All code is checked in after review and approval of a pull-request. For 3rd party contribution, the commit message and logs will include all the details of author and committer.

|LC30|The libraries mentioned in LC20 are available as Open Source software|All mandatory dependencies are available as open source software.
|LC40|Committers are bound by an Individual Contributor Agreement (the "Apache iCLA") that defines which code they may commit and how they need to identify code that is not their own.|The project uses a repository managed by Apache Gitbox, write access requires an Apache account, which requires an ICLA on file.
|LC50|The project clearly defines and documents the copyright ownership of everything that the project produces.|All files in the source repository have appropriate headers. An automated process is in place to ensure every file has expected headers.

|ID|Description|Status
|RE10|Releases consist of source code, distributed using standard and open archive formats that are expected to stay readable in the long term.|Releases are available via https://dlcdn.apache.org/incubator/hop/.
