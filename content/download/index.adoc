## Apache Hop

For each release you can find a download of the source code which can be used to build your own version.
We recommend using the pre-build binary release, this includes all dependencies required to run and use the software.

Apache Hop requires Java 11 to be installed on the system.

More information can be found in the readme files included in the download archives.
