== Known Issue

There is a known issue where text is displayed as white on a white background in Windows. Enable the 'Use look of OS' option in `Options -> Look & Feel` to avoid this.

== Hop Server

* Hop Server can now be started with https://hop.apache.org/manual/latest/hop-server/index.html#_ssl_configuration[SSL (https) enabled].
* https://hop.apache.org/manual/latest/hop-server/async-web-service.html[Asynchronous web services] can be used to execute long-running workflows. Instead of results, this webservice returns a unique ID that can be used to query the server for that workflow or pipeline's status.
* Hop Server can now be started with projects and environments as parameters.

== Docker

* the project and environment name are now optional
* project and environment are now supported in long-lived container
* logging options can now be set in the long-lived container (max_log_lines, max_log_timeout_minutes, object_timeout_minutes).
* the short-lived container now returns the correct exit code for the executed hop-run command.

== Apache Beam updates and improvements

Hop 1.1.0 comes with new and updated Apache Beam libraries.

* upgraded versions: Apache Beam in Hop was upgraded to 2.35.0, with support for Apache Spark 3.1.2 and Flink 1.13.5.
* Beam on Google Cloud Dataflow now supports service accounts.
* Beam on Google Cloud Dataflow now support DataflowServiceOptions which pass various options through if they're not available in the GUI

== New and updated plugins

* the https://hop.apache.org/manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/serverstatus.html[**Hop Server Status**] transform retrieves a lot of server and operating system metrics from one of your Hop Servers.
* the https://hop.apache.org/manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/apache-tika.html[**Apache Tika**] transform parses files in all sorts of formats and extracts the text content as well as available metadata it can extract.
* the https://hop.apache.org/manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/metadata-input.html[**Metadata Input**] gives you access to the Hop Metadata items in the current project. It outputs all the metadata objects of all types unless one or more types are filtered.
* the https://hop.apache.org/manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/neo4j-graphoutput.html[**Neo4j Graph Output**] transform now supports
** models with multiple relationships between two nodes
** models with multiple node labels
** models with self-relationships

== Hop Gui improvements

Hop GUI continues to evolve. Hop 1.1.0 contains a lot of minor improvements that together significantly improve the Hop user experience.

* large pipelines and workflows: sometimes there is no way around building or working with large workflows and pipelines (even though that is against https://hop.apache.org/manual/latest/best-practices/index.html#_size_matters[best practices]). Hop Gui now lets you scroll through large workflows and pipelines correctly. The additional **SCROLL-drag** gesture makes navigating large workflows and pipelines in Hop GUI even easier.
* File Explorer Perspective:
** files and folders are now loaded lazily, reducing the need to wait for refreshes or a "hanging" Hop Gui.
** any text file type can now be edited in the File Explorer perspective (this was only possible for CSV and JSON in Hop 1.0).
** users now get a warning when trying to open large files

== Various

* Log4j removal: Hop never actively used Log4j but included Log4j libraries for developer convenience. These libraries have been removed in 1.1.0.
* Kafka consumer transform improvements: improved error handling, logging from sub-pipelines is now passed to parent pipeline.
* search in the context (popup) dialog is now keyword-aware. This works with internationalization, so searching for keywords in your own language (if available in Hop) also works.
* CockroachDB is now a supported database type
* documentation continues to grow in depth and in breadth. Hop 1.1.0 contains almost 500 individual documentation pages.
* English, French and Italian have complete translations. The other supported languages have been moved to beta. Check the https://hop.apache.org/community/contribution-guides/translation-contribution-guide/[translation contribution guide] if you want to help to translate Hop to your own language.
