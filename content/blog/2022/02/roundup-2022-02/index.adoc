== Hop Graduation - Apache Software Foundation Press Release

Everyone who follows Apache Hop knows we graduated to a Top-Level Project in the final days of 2021.

Since not everyone follows Hop (yet), the Apache Hop PMC worked with the Apache Software Foundation to issues a press release that was sent out on January 18th.

Home to over 350 projects, some of which are wildly popular, the ASF has access to a massive audience. The press release created a major surge in the Apache Hop website visitor and downloads. With the increase in numbers, we saw a lot of new attention from Asia, especially China.

We'd like to take this opportunity to welcome all new Hop users and enthusiasts the Apache Hop community!

[[hop-1.1.0]]
== Apache Hop 1.1.0

On January 24th, the Apache Hop PMC and community released Apache Hop 1.1.0.

All the details about this release are available in the link:/blog/2022/01/hop-1.1.0/[release announcement], so let's just walk through a number highlights:

* Hop Server now supports SSL, projects and environments and asynchronous web services for long-running pipelines and workflows. There also is a new Hop Server Status transform.
* the Docker image now supports optionally supports projects and environments, has additional logging information and status code improvements.
* Apache Beam has been upgraded to 2.35.0 with support for Apache Spark 2.35.0 and Apache Flink 1.13.5. Apache Beam on Google Cloud Dataflow now supports service accounts and `DataflowServiceOptions`, which pass various options through if theyâ€™re not available in the GUI
* new transform plugins:
** Hop Server Status: retrieves a lot of server and operating system metrics from one of your Hop Servers.
** Apache Tika Input parses files in all sorts of formats and extracts the text content as well as available metadata it can extract.
** Metadata Input gives you access to the Hop Metadata items in the current project. It outputs all the metadata objects of all types unless one or more types are filtered.
** Neo4j Graph Output now supports models with multiple relationships between two nodes, models with multiple node labels and models with self-relationships
* Log4j completely removed

[[Various]]
== Various

With the busy start of the year running up to the Hop 1.1.0, the Apache Hop community hasn't had a lot of time to work on spectacular new features since the Hop 1.1.0 release.

A couple of items worth highlighting:

* the Apache Kafka have been getting quite a bit of attention in code hardening and robustness. Expect some additional functionality in this area soon.
* an Avro Encode transform is work in progress
* the Hop 2.0 branch now builds with Java 11. Follow progress on the https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Hop/job/Hop-integration-tests-java11/[Hop build server].
* Hop now support ARM on Linux and in the Docker container

=== new Contributions

With the increased Apache Hop visibility after the graduation and the 1.1.0 release, we've seen a significant uptick in the number of forks of the Hop github code repository and contributions. We'll work on updates statistics on community interaction and contributions soon.

A couple of notable new contributions are SonarCube code cleanup and fixes, Brazilian Portuguese translations and a new https://hop.apache.org/manual/latest/how-to-guides/apache-hop-web-services-docker.html[Hop web services in Docker tutorial]. A huge thank you to everyone who contributed!

=== New Committers

The Apache Hop welcomed two new committers in January:

* https://github.com/uraychang[Yu-Jui (Ray) Chang]: Ray started picking up small JIRA tickets months ago and has since then grown to become a valuable member of the Hop development team.
* https://twitter.com/rdegouvea[Ricardo Gouvea]: started the Hop community in Brazil and has been very active in evangelising Hop in Brazil and in Portuguese. Ricardo is building a lot of hands-on Hop experience and provides lots of suggestions and feedback.

Check out the link:/community/team/[complete list] of committers and contributors.

Without community contribution, Hop is just a coding club! Please feel free to join, participate in the discussion, test, file bug tickets on the software or documentation, ... Contributing is a lot more than writing code.

Check out our link:/community/contributing/[contribution guides] and http://hop.apache.org/community/ethos/[Code of Conduct] to find out more.
