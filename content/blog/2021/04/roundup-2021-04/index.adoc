As always at the start of another new month, let's have a look at what happened at Hop over the last month. Here's the recap for March 2021!

## Neo4j integration

We're really excited to welcome full Neo4j integration in Hop!

The plugins that are now a part of Hop were already available from Matt's personal github https://github.com/mattcasters/hop-neo4j[repository]. Having all of this functionality available in the default Hop distribution is a major step forward.

This integration brings a ton of Neo4j functionality to Hop:

* Actions:
** **Check Neo4j Connections**: Check to see if a Neo4j connection is available
** **Neo4j Cypher Script**: Execute a Neo4j cypher script
** **Neo4j Metadata Update**: Updates the metadata and lineage information in an audit graph
* Transforms:
** **Get Neo4j Logging Info**: Queries the Neo4j logging graph
** **Neo4j Cypher**: Reads from or writes to Neo4j with parameter data from input fields
** **Neo4j Generate CSV's**: generates CSV files for nodes and relationships to load with neo4j-import.
** **Neo4j Graph Output**: write to a Neo4j graph using an input field mapping
** **Neo4j Import**: runs an import command using the provided CSV files
** **Neo4j Output**: loads nodes and relationships to a Neo4j graph
** **Neo4j Split Graph**: splits the nodes and relationships of a graph data type
* **Neo4j perspective**: to check and query the Neo4j execution logs. All it takes is to point your `NEO4J_LOGGING_CONNECTION` to a valid Neo4j connection.
* Metadata Types:
** **Neo4j Connection**: connections to your Neo4j databases
** **Neo4j Graph Model**: description of the nodes, relationships, indexes of a Neo4j graph

## New file explorer perspective

March didn't bring just one, but two new perspectives!

The new File Explorer perspective not only brings file handlers for JSON, CSV, TXT, XML etc, it also comes with Git integration. +
This allows Hop users and developers to manage version control for workflows, pipelines and metadata files directly in Hop Gui.

This new perspective contains a visual git diff that quickly lets you check e.g. which transforms in a pipeline have been created, updated or deleted.

With this perspective, Hop Gui made another step towards providing a complete developer environment that enables Hop users and developers to be more productive.

[[metadata-types]]
## New Metadata Types

Hop welcomed a number of new metadata types in March:

* Apache Cassandra Connection
* MongoDB Connection
* Neo4j Connection
* Neo4j Graph Model
* Splunk Connection

[[vfs-types]]
## VFS Drivers

https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-vfs/[Apache VFS] (part of the Commons project) presents a uniform view of the files from various different sources, such as the files on local disk, on an HTTP server.

VFS has been supported in Hop since the early days, but is now support for the three major cloud platforms:

* AWS: `s3://`
* Azure: `azure://`
* Google Cloud Platform:
** Google Cloud Storage `gs://`
** Google Drive: `googledrive://`

Not only has the functionality been added, we've also made it as easy as possible to configure Hop for your favorite cloud platform:
